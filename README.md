# ATAC-Seq and ArchR Analysis Pipeline

## Introduction

This project leverages ATAC-Seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) and ArchR, an R-based framework, to analyze chromatin accessibility. By identifying open chromatin regions, the project provides insights into regulatory elements that influence gene expression. The goal is to understand chromatin accessibility dynamics across different conditions and integrate the results with transcriptomic data for a comprehensive view of gene regulation.

## Why is this Analysis Important?

1. Identifies Regulatory Elements: Open chromatin regions indicate active gene regulation sites.

2. Correlates Epigenetics with Gene Expression: Integrates ATAC-Seq with RNA-Seq to infer regulatory mechanisms.

3. Reveals Cell Type-Specific Differences: Enables identification of unique chromatin landscapes in different cell populations.

4. Supports Disease Research: Helps in identifying epigenetic changes associated with diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration.

## Methodology

**1. Initialize ArchR Environment**

i. Load the ArchR package and set the reference genome (mm10 for mouse or hg38 for human).

ii. Define the project directory for storing analysis results.

**2. Load or Create an ArchR Project**

i. If an existing ArchR project is found, load it.

ii. Otherwise, process ATAC-Seq arrow files to create a new ArchRProject.

**3. Quality Control and Data Filtering**

i. Filter low-quality cells based on:

ii. TSS enrichment scores (measures nucleosome-free regions at transcription start sites)

iii. Fragment counts per cell (detects sequencing artifacts)

iv. Remove doublets using ArchRâ€™s built-in methods.

**4. Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering**

i. Perform Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) for dimensionality reduction.

ii. Use UMAP/t-SNE for visualization.

iii. Cluster cells and annotate based on marker genes.

**5. Marker Gene Analysis**

i. Identify differentially accessible regions (DARs).

ii. Associate chromatin accessibility peaks with genes.

iii. Generate heatmaps and violin plots for gene accessibility visualization.

**6. Motif Enrichment and Peak Callin**g

i. Perform peak calling to identify accessible chromatin regions.

ii. Run motif enrichment analysis to find transcription factor binding sites.

iii. Generate motif heatmaps for visualization.

**7. Gene Activity Scores and Integration**

i. Compute Gene Score Matrices to infer gene activity from ATAC-Seq data.

ii. Integrate ATAC-Seq with RNA-Seq for correlation analysis.

**8. Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis**

i. Construct cellular trajectories to infer differentiation pathways.

ii. Identify pseudotime progression states.

## Results and Key Insights

1. Identified key differentially accessible chromatin regions.

2. Found transcription factors enriched in open chromatin sites.

3. Integrated RNA-Seq data to correlate chromatin accessibility with gene expression.

4. Constructed cellular trajectories showing differentiation states.

## Prerequisites

1. R version 4.0+

2. ArchR package (install.packages('ArchR'))

3. Required dependencies: BiocManager, data.table, ggplot2, ComplexHeatmap

## Conclusion

This ATAC-Seq analysis pipeline, powered by ArchR, provides a robust framework for studying chromatin accessibility. By integrating chromatin and transcriptomic data, it enhances our understanding of gene regulation and cellular identity, ultimately contributing to disease research and precision medicine.
